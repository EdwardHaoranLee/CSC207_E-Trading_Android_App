Within this project, we utilized a wide range of deisgn patterns and diverse programming design principles. It started as a Java project and then been transformed into an Android app. There are a few major functionalities:
- Users can create account, sign in account and sign out account.
- Every user can post the information of their vacant items to a "market", which they can also view others' postings.
- Users can send requests to another user for an item on the market for a one-way or two-way transection. The transection can be temporary or permanent. 
- Users can search up the market using keyword and the app will return a list of best matches.
- Admin accounts can be created which is used to manage the disputes among regular users.
